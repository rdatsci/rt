#' Update packages. This includes multiple steps:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{1.}{All outdated CRAN packages will be updated.}
#'   \item{2.}{If \code{rebuild} is set to \code{TRUE}, all packages which
#'      are built under a different R version will be rebuilt with the current.}
#'   \item{3.}{CRAN packages which are listed in \code{~/.rt/packages} but are not
#'     found on the system will be installed.}
#'   \item{4.}{All packages with a git source listed in \code{~/.rt/packages} will be updated and
#'     re-installed if necessary.}
#' }
#' The collection file \code{~/.rt/packages} expects one package per line specified in a format
#' which is parseable by \code{\link{stringToPackage}}. Leading and trailing whitespace characters
#' will automatically be trimmed. Empty lines and lines starting with a \dQuote{#} will be ignored.
#'
#' @param rebuild [\code{logical(1)}]\cr
#'  Rebuild R packages which are built using a different version of R.
#' @param neverupgrade [code{logical(1)}]\cr
#'  Passed to \code{\link[remotes]{update_packages}} as \code{upgrade = ifelse(neverupgrade, "never", "always")}.
#'  Default is \dQuote{FALSE} so all dependencies are upgraded.
#' @template return-itrue
