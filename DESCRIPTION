Description: Shipping some command line utilities which
    simplify working with R packages from the command line. Many commands rt
    provides are just wrappers around 'devtools' but ensure a valid exit code
    which is required to use these commands for shell scripting.
    Furthermore, rt allows you to maintain a collection of you favorite packages
    in a plain text file which you can add to your dot-files and share across
    systems. This file may also contain git sources to keep you up to date with
    packages not yet released on CRAN.
