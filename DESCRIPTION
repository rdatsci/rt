Version: 0.1
Author: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Description: This package ships some command line utilities which
    simplify working with R packages from the command line. Many commands rt
    provides are just wrappers around devtools but ensure a valid exit code
    which is required to use these commands for shell scripting.
    Furthermore, rt allows you to maintain a collection of you favorite packages
    in a plain text file which you can add to your dotfiles and share across
    systems. This file may also contain git sources to keep you up to date with
    packages not yet released on CRAN.
